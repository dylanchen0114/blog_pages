One night I decide to use GitHub Pages to host my own site, and try to write posts about what I learned from daily works or kaggle competitions (mainly focusing on machine learning and coding). I will try my best to write down notes here as many as possible and hope you visitors will find something useful here and follow this mini-blog so as to follow my trip to be a real data scientist.
